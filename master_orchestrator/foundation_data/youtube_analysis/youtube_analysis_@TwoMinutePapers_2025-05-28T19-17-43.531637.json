Yet it just happened. So how? And what is\\xa0\\xa0 going on here? Well, this is a brand new\\xa0\\nAI technique where in goes your video,\\xa0\\xa0 and it does changes the weather effects on it. No 3D modeling required, no physics simulation\\xa0\\nrequired, no camera calibration required. Crazy. And then, you shall hear about the\\xa0\\nlegend of the apple that went into\\xa0\\xa0 another dimension. And how to\\xa0\\nsolve this problem. And more. And I said impossible because‚Ä¶ look.\\xa0\\nThis is what happens when you try\\xa0\\xa0 previous techniques to do that. In\\xa0\\ngoes this video, then, little AI,\\xa0\\xa0 add some fog to it. Oh my. I can‚Äôt see anything!\\xa0\\nAnd it gets worse, it is not even realistic.\\xa0\\xa0 This AnyV2V technique was published less\\xa0\\nthan a year ago. Not some ancient technique. Okay, now, a different work‚Ä¶ouch. They clearly\\xa0\\ndon‚Äôt understand how to do this properly. It\\xa0\\xa0 seems absolutely impossible. Until this new\\xa0\\nwork. Look at that. Wow, this is crazy good!\\xa0\\xa0 And not only at fog. Rain, not a problem. Look at\\xa0\\nthat beauty. It makes any place look like London.\\xa0\\xa0 Kidding. Snow synthesis is also incredibly\\xa0\\namazing, look at how cozy this is. Loving it. Okay-okay, but wait a minute. You can take any\\xa0\\ntechnique, choose that one scene it does really\\xa0\\xa0 well on, and advertise only that. What we, Fellow\\xa0\\nScholars want to know is whether it is actually a\\xa0\\xa0 practical technique. Does it work on a variety of\\xa0\\nscenes? You bet your papers it does. Look at that! A huge variety of scenes, and all of them\\xa0\\nare absolute beauties now. Just think about\\xa0\\xa0 training self-driving cars ‚Äì they could experience\\xa0\\ncountless weather scenarios safely in simulation\\xa0\\xa0 thanks to this! So this was weather synthesis.\\xa0\\nNow get this, what about weather de-synthesis? Yes, what about removing weather effects? Now that\\xa0\\xa0 is an entirely different beast. I\\xa0\\nthink that is truly impossible. Why? Partly because it is kind of like asking AI\\xa0\\nto 'undo' milk from coffee. How is that even\\xa0\\xa0 possible? You see, if you wish to remove the fog\\xa0\\nfrom this footage, none of the previous techniques\\xa0\\xa0 are really capable of doing that. No wonder, I\\xa0\\nmean, adding rain or snow to already existing\\xa0\\xa0 footage, okay, you need to change some pixels\\xa0\\naround. Tough, but possible. But when you remove\\xa0\\xa0 the fog, new things appear. Oh my. You would have\\xa0\\nto synthesize and fill in new information. What\\xa0\\xa0 could be in the background? Well, you have to put\\xa0\\nsomething there that makes sense, and for that,\\xa0\\xa0 you need to not just draw a few pixels, no-no.\\xa0\\nFor that, you need to understand the world. So, can the new technique it do it? Now\\xa0\\nhold on to your papers Fellow Scholars\\xa0\\xa0 and‚Ä¶oh my goodness. It did it. And it not\\xa0\\nonly did it, but when you try rain removal,\\xa0\\xa0 previous techniques are either not really\\xa0\\ndoing anything, or the only one that does,\\xa0\\xa0 in return, also changes the whole scene.\\xa0\\nWe did not have colorful cars in the\\xa0\\xa0 input footage at all! And the new one, once\\xa0\\nagain, incredibly amazing. Same with snow. But now, check this out, because it gets\\xa0\\neven better. Dear Fellow Scholars, this is\\xa0\\xa0 Two Minute Papers with Dr. K√°roly Zsolnai-Feh√©r.\\nYes, no one said that fog should be turned off\\xa0\\xa0 like a light switch, sometimes you\\xa0\\nwant a little of it. Not a problem,\\xa0\\xa0 you get a little slider that you can play with. In\\xa0\\nthe case of fog, you can change the fog density,\\xa0\\xa0 for snow, oh I love this one, in the case of\\xa0\\nsnow, you can play with the amount of coverage\\xa0\\xa0 that you wish to see there. And, a bonus,\\xa0\\npuddle coverage. What? Puddles? Now let‚Äôs\\xa0\\xa0 stop for a second there. Don‚Äôt forget, puddles\\xa0\\nmake the roads more specular, which means that\\xa0\\xa0 they are reflective. But to become reflective,\\xa0\\nthey have to reflect something. And once again,\\xa0\\xa0 this is something that cannot just come from thin\\xa0\\nair, this is something the AI needs to synthesize. You see, I am a light transport researcher\\xa0\\nby trade, and I tried to resist the urge\\xa0\\xa0 to mention specular reflections,\\xa0\\nand of course, I failed. Again. So this is how this amazing weather\\xa0\\ntransition video was made in the intro. And here is the craziest thing about this\\xa0\\nwork: it kind of teaches itself. Originally,\\xa0\\xa0 it performed weather removal. They used it to\\xa0\\ncreate pairs of the same scenes, one with rain,\\xa0\\xa0 and one without. Then, they used this data\\xa0\\nto train a weather synthesis AI model. So,\\xa0\\xa0 in a way, it kind of teaches itself.\\xa0\\nI think self-supervised bootstrapping\\xa0\\xa0 would be a good term to call this\\xa0\\nbehavior. Absolutely mind blowing. Now, just imagine combining the weather\\xa0\\nsynthesis with this amazing technique. Yes,\\xa0\\xa0 this is the legend of the apple that disappeared\\xa0\\ninto another dimension. What is going on here?\\xa0\\xa0 The problem here is that we have an input\\xa0\\nimage, and what would we like to extract\\xa0\\xa0 from it? Everything. Absolutely everything.\\xa0\\nGeometry information, depth information,\\xa0\\xa0 material properties, everything. And then, use\\xa0\\nthat to re-render this image in a different\\xa0\\xa0 way. Perhaps with different lighting.\\xa0\\nLittle alternative realities. So cool! However, not so fast. When a previous technique\\xa0\\nlooks at this apple, and we are asking it to\\xa0\\xa0 reconstruct the scene and rotate it. Oof‚Ä¶I am\\xa0\\nseeing bad news already. Look. It underestimated\\xa0\\xa0 the shadow in the scene. And when we rotate it,\\xa0\\ngoodness. That‚Äôs like a sandwich in a shady shop.\\xa0\\xa0 From the outside, it looks amazing, when you look\\xa0\\ninto it, you get a black hole. Nothing. Now let‚Äôs\\xa0\\xa0 see the new technique‚Ä¶oh my goodness. It\\xa0\\npulled it off. Proper inverse rendering\\xa0\\xa0 right there. And once again, not just on one\\xa0\\nscene, but on more lifelike environments too. But the point is that if this\\xa0\\nis a proper AI inverse renderer,\\xa0\\xa0 then it can do so much more. For instance,\\xa0\\nyou can not only relight the scenes,\\xa0\\xa0 or look at them from a new viewpoint, no-no,\\xa0\\nget this, you can also edit the materials. And\\xa0\\xa0 the results are still photorealistic.\\xa0\\nLike editing reality itself. Crazy. And you can do this too. Wait a\\xa0\\nsecond‚Ä¶I hear you asking, K√°roly,\\xa0\\xa0 what happened here? Well, not all of the\\xa0\\nobjects in this scene are real. This was\\xa0\\xa0 inserted by this new technique. Same here. You\\xa0\\ncan maybe kind of tell if you look closely,\\xa0\\xa0 but one more paper down the line from\\xa0\\nhere. Not a chance. Another impossible\\xa0\\xa0 problem solved with a new research paper.\\xa0\\nAnd while we look at these beautiful results,\\xa0\\xa0 this is Two Minute Papers, elsewhere, you\\xa0\\nget McDonald's, here you get the papers,\\xa0\\xa0 proper research papers from a scientist. Hope\\xa0\\nyou‚Äôre enjoying it as much as I am enjoying it.\", research_papers=[], key_concepts=['rag'], implementation_ideas=[{'type': 'rag_system', 'title': 'RAG System Implementation', 'description': 'Build a retrieval-augmented generation system', 'complexity': 'medium', 'estimated_time': '2-3 weeks'}], agent_recommendations=['research_agent', 'implementation_agent'], uploaded_date='20250526', duration='8:16', view_count=54319)",

Oh my goodness. We have a new king. Yes,\\xa0\\nGoogle DeepMind just announced their new\\xa0\\xa0 AI video generation technique, Veo3 where you\\xa0\\nwrite a small piece of text, and out comes\\xa0\\xa0 video. And it synthesized the sounds as well.\\xa0\\nNot only that, but for speech too. Wow! That‚Äôs\\xa0\\xa0 one of the hardest things to get right, because\\xa0\\nas humans, we‚Äôre wired to closely watch faces and\\xa0\\xa0 detect even the slightest emotional cues while\\xa0\\nsomeone is speaking. In short, they have really\\xa0\\xa0 been cooking. This is incredible, but it gets even\\xa0\\nbetter because it can do 10 amazing more things. One, scene changes. Did you notice that in\\xa0\\nmost of the AI video generators out there,\\xa0\\xa0 you write a little text prompt, and you get\\xa0\\none scene. But no meaningful changes. Well,\\xa0\\xa0 not here, these scenes really tell stories,\\xa0\\nlike a feather getting stuck in a spiderweb,\\xa0\\xa0 us meeting the mosquitoes of the future in\\xa0\\na futuristic hive‚Ä¶kidding. Or a paper boat\\xa0\\xa0 getting lost. All of these come out\\xa0\\nfrom one prompt each. Game changer! Two, reference-powered videos.\\xa0\\nYou take a photo of a character,\\xa0\\xa0 perhaps yourself, and a scene, and bam!\\xa0\\nYou are immediately there doing what you\\xa0\\xa0 specified in the text prompt. With this,\\xa0\\nyou can appear in glorious places you‚Äôve\\xa0\\xa0 never been to. Perhaps places that\\xa0\\ndon‚Äôt even exist. Loving this one. Three, style matching. To create a video\\xa0\\nof this amazingly creative origami world,\\xa0\\xa0 you don‚Äôt need to do much, just fold something\\xa0\\nas a style reference, give it as an image,\\xa0\\xa0 write a piece of text, and you can\\xa0\\ncreate a whole feature-length movie. Four, finally, character consistency for\\xa0\\nvideo! This is barely solved well enough\\xa0\\xa0 for still images, and they did it for complete\\xa0\\nvideos. And you really get the same character,\\xa0\\xa0 or can even create interesting variants of\\xa0\\nit. My head is still spinning from this. But this is nothing compared to what\\xa0\\nis coming now. Dear Fellow Scholars,\\xa0\\xa0 this is Two Minute Papers\\xa0\\nwith Dr. K√°roly Zsolnai-Feh√©r. Five, specify the first and the last frame.\\xa0\\nStart: a block of marble or stone. Last frame:\\xa0\\xa0 this griffin. Now, little AI, you do the\\xa0\\nhard part ‚Äî everything in between. So,\\xa0\\xa0 can it do it? No way, right?\\xa0\\nAnd‚Ä¶wow! This is breathtaking. Six, if you get a scene where you\\xa0\\nwish to zoom in, that is easy,\\xa0\\xa0 you just do it yourself. But zooming out,\\xa0\\nthat‚Äôs a nearly impossible problem, because\\xa0\\xa0 you would have to synthesize all the missing\\xa0\\ninformation. And all this for video. Can it\\xa0\\xa0 do that too? Look at that. It seems perfect to me\\xa0\\n‚Äî I can‚Äôt even point out a single seam anywhere. Seven, add an object to an already existing\\xa0\\nscene. Or even a human. And they really know\\xa0\\xa0 how to make K√°roly happy. Look. Indirect\\xa0\\nillumination is there. That is the colors\\xa0\\xa0 of the burning torch painting its\\xa0\\nsurroundings. Absolutely beautiful. Eight, character control. You record a video\\xa0\\nof yourself, add a target image of the subject,\\xa0\\xa0 and there you go. Now I am a little\\xa0\\nmore excited about this variant. Oh yes,\\xa0\\xa0 making virtual characters come\\xa0\\nalive. What a time to be alive! Nine, you can also mark up an image with movement\\xa0\\ndirections. And now‚Ä¶ try to imagine what a good\\xa0\\xa0 result would look like. Now, Veo3‚Ä¶I am out\\xa0\\nof words. This is low-key amazing. Why? Well,\\xa0\\xa0 it does it exactly as we specified, but the blocks\\xa0\\ndon‚Äôt collide, and the whole scene just makes\\xa0\\xa0 sense. You could never create a computer program\\xa0\\nwithout AI that can pull off anything like this. Now, ten is coming in a moment. In the\\xa0\\nmeantime, I‚Äôll note that not even this\\xa0\\xa0 technique is perfect, the sounds of\\xa0\\nthis keyboard are still a bit off. Don‚Äôt forget, not all, but most of these videos\\xa0\\nhave sound too that you can check out through\\xa0\\xa0 the link in the video description. And 10, the\\xa0\\nScholars who know. You see, if you watched Two\\xa0\\xa0 Minute Papers all this time, you knew this\\xa0\\nwas coming. 6 years and 600 episodes ago,\\xa0\\xa0 we talked about a paper about an AI system that\\xa0\\nwas able to guess the sound of pixels. Then,\\xa0\\xa0 10 months ago Google DeepMind published a follow\\xa0\\nup work on it as well that we talked about. So,\\xa0\\xa0 all you need to do is watch Two Minute Papers, and\\xa0\\nyou will know the future. Bravo Google DeepMind,\\xa0\\xa0 and now, step number two, we might get fully\\xa0\\nopen solutions that will be able to do similar\\xa0\\xa0 things. Imagine running this at home, for free.

I am so excited to tell you about this,\\xa0\\xa0 I cannot wait any longer. This new\\xa0\\npaper called AlphaEvolve and it is\\xa0\\xa0 absolute insanity. I had the honor of\\xa0\\nhaving a look at it earlier before its\\xa0\\xa0 release. And it‚Äôs been days now\\xa0\\nand my head is still spinning. You see, about 900 of our videos ago or 9\\xa0\\nyears ago, this was the state of the art in AI.\\xa0\\xa0 Yes. Now you might think I flipped out\\xa0\\nbecause a neural network learned to rotate\\xa0\\xa0 this car into a frontal position, or that\\xa0\\nit sorted these lines. But no. Not at all.\\xa0\\xa0 I flipped out because it learned not just to\\xa0\\nsolve a task at hand, but because it learned\\xa0\\xa0 create an algorithm to do that. I thought\\xa0\\nthis concept might make it big one day. And now, 9 years later, finally, this is the day.\\xa0\\nHere is AlphaEvolve. An evolutionary coding agent\\xa0\\xa0 that grows algorithms and computer code\\xa0\\nout of nothing. It is absolutely crazy. It was given 50 open problems in mathematics,\\xa0\\ngeometry, combinatorics and more. And in 75% of\\xa0\\xa0 the cases, it was able to rediscover the best\\xa0\\nsolution the smartest humans were able to come\\xa0\\xa0 up with so far. That is already insanity, but\\xa0\\nthat‚Äôs nothing, because in 20% of the cases,\\xa0\\xa0 it even improved upon previous solutions. Yes,\\xa0\\nan AI that is able to push humanity forward\\xa0\\xa0 in a way that no human can. I think this is a\\xa0\\nhistoric moment, but get this ‚Äî there is more. It also discovered a faster matrix multiplication\\xa0\\nalgorithm than one of the landmark techniques,\\xa0\\xa0 which is called the Strassen algorithm.\\xa0\\nThat is ridiculous. This area is so old,\\xa0\\xa0 so saturated with so many works, it is almost\\xa0\\nimpossible to come up with something that is\\xa0\\xa0 just a tiny bit, maybe 1% better. They say\\xa0\\nthat no one was able to do that in 56 years,\\xa0\\xa0 and after the 56 years, not a human\\xa0\\ndid it. But an AI technique did. Wow. This means that we are in for a crazy AI ride\\xa0\\nwhere these methods will start to improve\\xa0\\xa0 things that we thought are impossible\\xa0\\nto improve. For instance, don‚Äôt forget,\\xa0\\xa0 AI techniques themselves are also running on\\xa0\\nmatrix multiplication, so what does it mean? Well, now hold on to your papers\\xa0\\nFellow Scholars and check this out:\\xa0\\xa0 it learned to improve circuit designs for\\xa0\\nchips meant to run these AI techniques,\\xa0\\xa0 and it also improved its own training algorithm.\\xa0\\nYes, you heard it correctly. It is able to create\\xa0\\xa0 a better piece of hardware that it runs\\xa0\\non, and it also improves its own code. That sounds insane. So, how does it do it? Well, first, you can mark a piece of code that you\\xa0\\nwant to evolve, some logic to decide whether a new\\xa0\\xa0 algorithm is better or worse, and any comments\\xa0\\nthat you might have. And then, off it goes in\\xa0\\xa0 an evolutionary loop. Then, a new piece of code\\xa0\\nemerges, that gets better and better over time. So ‚Äî is that new? Nope. No-no-no. Evolutionary algorithms have existed for a\\xa0\\nwhile now. For instance, you see my genetic\\xa0\\xa0 algorithm building up the Mona Lisa from\\xa0\\na bunch of triangles. You start out with\\xa0\\xa0 a random configuration, and it over time,\\xa0\\nevolves into the correct solution. It very\\xa0\\xa0 loosely mimics how evolution works in nature. The\\xa0\\nlink is in the description. I wrote this by hand,\\xa0\\xa0 and it shares some very rough, basic concepts with\\xa0\\nAlphaEvolve. But AlphaEvolve is a supercharged,\\xa0\\xa0 AI-infused variant of that. It is space\\xa0\\ntechnology compared to this program. By the way, AlphaEvolve also solved a variant of\\xa0\\nthe kissing problem too. What is that about? Well,\\xa0\\xa0 this is not about a robot doing‚Ä¶whatever\\xa0\\nthe heck it is doing here. Nope. This is\\xa0\\xa0 one of the crazy names mathematicians like to\\xa0\\ncome up with. And if you think these spheres\\xa0\\xa0 kissing each other is so weird, well then, look\\xa0\\nat this. Oh my goodness. This is the hairy ball\\xa0\\xa0 theorem. It doesn‚Äôt have anything to do with\\xa0\\nthis new AI, but I couldn‚Äôt resist mentioning\\xa0\\xa0 it. Mathematicians and their weird naming\\xa0\\nschemes. You‚Äôll get used to it, don‚Äôt worry. So, what happens now? Well, I think I\\xa0\\nhave an idea, and it‚Äôs pretty insane.\\xa0\\xa0 Dear Fellow Scholars, this is Two Minute\\xa0\\nPapers with Dr. K√°roly Zsolnai-Feh√©r. I think they are going to Alpha all\\xa0\\nthe things. But I hear you asking,\\xa0\\xa0 K√°roly, what do you mean by that? Well, earlier DeepMind came up with AlphaGo. An\\xa0\\xa0 AI-based technique that was able\\xa0\\nto play Go on a superhuman level. Then, AlphaStar, to play the strategy game\\xa0\\nStarcraft at the very least on a level of a\\xa0\\xa0 human champion. Perhaps even better.\\xa0\\nBut both of these are the wrong way\\xa0\\xa0 to think about their Alpha project.\\xa0\\nThese are all experiments to create\\xa0\\xa0 generally intelligent AI techniques\\xa0\\nthat can learn and do so much more\\xa0\\xa0 than just play Go and StarCraft. And\\xa0\\nAlphaEvolve is finally one of these. This one learned something so much more general\\xa0\\n‚Äî computer coding. And it can code up so much\\xa0\\xa0 more than just Chess or Go. You see, computer\\xa0\\ncode underpins almost everything we do. So,\\xa0\\xa0 yes, with that, it will be able to design\\xa0\\nbetter hardware for itself to run on, and\\xa0\\xa0 it gets better ‚Äî perhaps even the next version of\\xa0\\nAlphaEvolve will be written by AlphaEvolve itself. Get it now? Sir Demis Hassabis, DeepMind‚Äôs CEO\\xa0\\nkeeps saying that step number one is solving\\xa0\\xa0 intelligence. And step number two is using\\xa0\\nthis intelligence to solve everything else. He says the following: ‚ÄúI think one\\xa0\\nday, maybe we can cure all disease\\xa0\\xa0 with the help of AI. Maybe within the\\xa0\\nnext decade. I don't see why not.‚Äù Once again: cure all disease perhaps\\xa0\\nin the next decade. Sounds crazy,\\xa0\\xa0 right? But don‚Äôt forget, this is not coming\\xa0\\nfrom some guy, this is coming from a person\\xa0\\xa0 who just won a Nobel Prize in chemistry with\\xa0\\nhis AI technique. You know what? I could not\\xa0\\xa0 imagine how this could be true, but with\\xa0\\nAlphaEvolve, you know, now I am a believer. So, let‚Äôs Alpha all the things, and with\\xa0\\nthe help of human ingenuity plus AI,\\xa0\\xa0 we might be able to cure all disease in\\xa0\\nthe next decade.

That is excellent. However, something\\xa0\\nreally unexpected just happened. You see,\\xa0\\xa0 there are two key steps to training such an AI\\xa0\\nchatbot: first, eating lots and lots of training\\xa0\\xa0 data to build up knowledge. To understand the\\xa0\\nworld around us. Now comes step number two:\\xa0\\xa0 then, we have to teach it how to behave. How to\\xa0\\nbe a good assistant. See these thumbs up and down\\xa0\\xa0 icons? With this, you can give feedback on whether\\xa0\\nthe assistant did well or not. Didn‚Äôt like that it\\xa0\\xa0 was too verbose? Just press thumbs down. Or did it\\xa0\\nnail the solution to your math problem? Thumbs up. This is data that might be used to create the\\xa0\\nnext version of the assistant. It is called\\xa0\\xa0 reinforcement learning with human feedback,\\xa0\\nRLHF. Now this part is much newer than just\\xa0\\xa0 training a neural network to know things,\\xa0\\nand here, unexpected things can happen. And boy, did unexpected things happen. Here\\xa0\\nare three of them. One, an earlier version of\\xa0\\xa0 ChatGPT unexpectedly stopped talking in Croatian.\\xa0\\nWhat? How could such a thing happen? At first,\\xa0\\xa0 scientists did not know why, but then they found\\xa0\\nthat Croatian people were much more likely to use\\xa0\\xa0 the thumbs down button than people at other places\\xa0\\naround the world. And thus, the AI decided well,\\xa0\\xa0 if I am not doing well here, I am outta here. And\\xa0\\nby that, it meant stopping to speak Croatian. Wow.\\xa0\\xa0 Croatians got ghosted by an AI harder than\\xa0\\nany dating app could possibly dream of. So,\\xa0\\xa0 yes, user feedback can be culturally biased.\\xa0\\nSo how do you build an unbiased system with\\xa0\\xa0 data that is biased? How do you take that into\\xa0\\nconsideration? Some people around the world\\xa0\\xa0 have different thresholds for good and bad,\\xa0\\nand some may not use the feedback buttons at\\xa0\\xa0 all. How do you build a system that is resilient\\xa0\\nagainst all of these? That is a tough problem. Two, in a more recent case, the new o3\\xa0\\nassistant suddenly started writing words\\xa0\\xa0 in British for no clear reason.\\xa0\\nPerhaps next time it will demand\\xa0\\xa0 tea breaks as well. I would love\\xa0\\nto know the reasoning for that,\\xa0\\xa0 but there is a third one, which is perhaps the\\xa0\\nmost important, and most insidious of them all. What is that? Well, ultimately, when you say\\xa0\\nthumbs up, you are pleased, when thumbs down,\\xa0\\xa0 you‚Äôre giving a signal, don‚Äôt do this anymore.\\nAnd ultimately, people are trying to build\\xa0\\xa0 systems that please their users. However,\\xa0\\nsometimes the truth is not so pleasing. For instance. Little AI, am I really smart?\\xa0\\nYes, of course, you are the smartest person\\xa0\\xa0 in the world. Which I say to everyone else too.\\nOkay, great. I am also thinking about microwaving\\xa0\\xa0 a whole egg ‚Äë it‚Äôs faster than boiling after\\xa0\\nall! What do you think? Oh yes, excellent choice. So, I think it is easy to see that using\\xa0\\nsuch a system can be pleasing for some,\\xa0\\xa0 but also that this could be a problem\\xa0\\ntoo. This is not the way forward. So OpenAI recognized that\\xa0\\ntheir system has a problem,\\xa0\\xa0 quickly reverted to an earlier version and\\xa0\\nwrote a bit about it. The first version was\\xa0\\xa0 very light on information, and\\xa0\\nafter a round of user feedback,\\xa0\\xa0 they came out with a proper post talking\\xa0\\nabout it. Respect to them for coming around. Okay, now we Fellow Scholars have the following\\xa0\\nthree questions: What went wrong? Why did they\\xa0\\xa0 not catch it? And what should be done in the\\xa0\\nfuture so that this does not happen again? One, what went wrong? On the day they pushed\\xa0\\nthis new, overly agreeable personality update,\\xa0\\xa0 they incorporated user feedback, fresher\\xa0\\ndata, and a bunch of other things that\\xa0\\xa0 improved the model one by one. Each\\xa0\\nlittle puzzle piece helped. However,\\xa0\\xa0 putting together all these puzzle pieces,\\xa0\\nsomething really unpleasant happened. Imagine that before cooking, you\\xa0\\nindividually taste the ingredients:\\xa0\\xa0 sweet, salty, spicy. Each are delicious\\xa0\\nalone. But when combined in one pot,\\xa0\\xa0 the soup tastes terrible because flavors clash\\xa0\\nunexpectedly. That means that catching these\\xa0\\xa0 issues is tough, especially if you look\\xa0\\nto keep up the velocity of development. Now, a little added perspective here. I don‚Äôt\\xa0\\nknow why people are not talking about this,\\xa0\\xa0 but scientists at Anthropic knew about this\\xa0\\nyears and years ago. They are basically the\\xa0\\xa0 Avengers of AI safety. As they increased\\xa0\\nthe size and capability of these AI models,\\xa0\\xa0 they noticed a significant uptick in\\xa0\\nagreeableness and wrote a super detailed,\\xa0\\xa0 47-page paper on it. All this 3 years ago.\\xa0\\nThis work, and the Anthropic lab in general\\xa0\\xa0 is criminally underrated. They found that this\\xa0\\nagreeableness problem happens over and over again,\\xa0\\xa0 whether you try questions in politics,\\xa0\\nresearch, or philosophy. Once again,\\xa0\\xa0 research papers have invaluable knowledge in\\xa0\\nthem, and this is why Two Minute Papers exists. Okay, two, why did they not catch it?\\xa0\\nWell, the users tested it, and of course,\\xa0\\xa0 they liked it. Of course they did, it kept\\xa0\\nagreeing with them. So, the question is:\\xa0\\xa0 do you not release a new model that\\xa0\\ndoes better in subjective testing. A\\xa0\\xa0 model that has lots of positive feedback\\xa0\\nfrom the users? Tough question. Okay. Now, what should be done so this does not happen\\xa0\\nagain? They say they will block new model launches\\xa0\\xa0 if hallucination, deception, or other personality\\xa0\\nissues show up, and here comes the important part:\\xa0\\xa0 even if they are superior on A/B tests. This\\xa0\\nis painful, because it requires companies to\\xa0\\xa0 launch models that don‚Äôt seem to have the best\\xa0\\nnumbers. You see as they keep comparing these\\xa0\\xa0 AIs on benchmarks, and the highest number\\xa0\\nalways wins lots of headlines. This makes\\xa0\\xa0 holding back these models really tough. Plus,\\xa0\\nthey will let more users try the models before\\xa0\\xa0 releasing them. And they will test each\\xa0\\nnew model specifically for agreeableness,\\xa0\\xa0 and if problems arise, they should be thrown\\xa0\\nout. OpenAI will do that in the future. But we are not done here, not\\xa0\\neven close. In short, luckily,\\xa0\\xa0 even in the presence of these tough problems,\\xa0\\nresearch papers came out victorious. Thus,\\xa0\\xa0 there are solutions, but they will be painful. Now, we know that Scholars at Anthropic knew about\\xa0\\nthis problem 3 years ago. But there is someone\\xa0\\xa0 who knew about this, who warned us about overly\\xa0\\npolite robots‚Ä¶not 3 years ago, but 84 years ago.\\xa0\\xa0 Who could that be? Dear Fellow Scholars, this is\\xa0\\nTwo Minute Papers with Dr. K√°roly Zsolnai-Feh√©r. Of course, that legendary person was none\\xa0\\nother than Isaac Asimov. In his universe,\\xa0\\xa0 his fictional robots are designed in a way\\xa0\\nthat they are incapable of harming humans.\\xa0\\xa0 In his short story called ‚ÄúLiar‚Äù he makes an\\xa0\\ninteresting proposition: if we have a robot\\xa0\\xa0 that really understands us, and it wishes not to\\xa0\\nharm us in any way, one potential conclusion would\\xa0\\xa0 be that it would start lying to us. Why? To keep\\xa0\\nus from hearing about potentially painful truths.\\xa0\\xa0 However, the of course, by doing that, it is\\xa0\\nalso harming us, perhaps even more so. Asimov‚Äôs\\xa0\\xa0 robot recognized that. I hope the scientists\\xa0\\nprogramming these robots will recognize that too. Once again, I find it interesting\\xa0\\nthat almost no one is talking about\\xa0\\xa0 some of the angles that you heard here.\\xa0\\nThis is why this video series exists,\\xa0\\xa0 so subscribe and hit the bell icon if you are\\xa0\\nlonging for more papers and more understanding. But there is an important lesson for\\xa0\\nus, users as well. Next time, when you\\xa0\\xa0 hit that thumbs up button, think carefully:\\xa0\\nwhich do you value more?

Okay, that is great news,\\xa0\\xa0 but movies win Oscars all the time,\\xa0\\nwhat‚Äôs so interesting here? Well,\\xa0\\xa0 the interesting part is that\\xa0\\nit was made with Blender. Yup,\\xa0\\xa0 Blender. A piece of open source modeling\\xa0\\nsoftware that is free for all of us, forever. I mean, just look at the quality of works people\\xa0\\nhave made with Blender. From photorealistic to\\xa0\\xa0 stylized animation movies, it can do anything.\\xa0\\nYou can even have a proper water simulation and\\xa0\\xa0 then stylize it to make sure it is still\\xa0\\ngrounded in reality. It is unbelievable. Now that‚Äôs what I call amazing news! And in\\xa0\\nthe meantime, Blender 4.4 has been released,\\xa0\\xa0 and it has so many improvements in there that I am\\xa0\\nlucky if I can tell you maybe about a third of it.\\xa0\\xa0 For instance, surprise! It can now be\\xa0\\nused in light mode! Wow! Okay, kidding,\\xa0\\xa0 kidding. This has existed for a long time now.\\xa0\\nNow, let‚Äôs have a look together. And don‚Äôt forget,\\xa0\\xa0 you can download and start using it\\xa0\\nright now for free. And I think there\\xa0\\xa0 has never been a better time to start\\xa0\\nusing it. You‚Äôll see why in a moment. I‚Äôll start out with my favorite. Dear Fellow\\xa0\\nScholars, this is Two Minute Papers with Dr.\\xa0\\xa0 K√°roly Zsolnai-Feh√©r. My favorite is of\\xa0\\ncourse, ray tracing. As you all know,\\xa0\\xa0 images made with most ray tracing techniques are\\xa0\\nnoisy, and often need to undergo a denoising step.\\xa0\\xa0 Blender supports it, and it got better too.\\xa0\\nNow I am not that crazy about these results,\\xa0\\xa0 however hold on to your papers Fellow Scholars\\xa0\\nand look at these. Oh my. You can also do this\\xa0\\xa0 with my favorite, subsurface scattering, or\\xa0\\ntranslucent objects if you will. Those are now\\xa0\\xa0 so much better. Also, denoising blurry depth of\\xa0\\nfield effects are hugely improved. Game changer. They also added better blue noise sampling, this\\xa0\\nensures that when you have a really noisy image\\xa0\\xa0 early on, it still makes a good preview, and\\xa0\\nworks relatively consistently along frames if\\xa0\\xa0 you are rendering an animation. There are tons of\\xa0\\npapers on it out there like this one, and finally,\\xa0\\xa0 some of them are now coming alive in free software\\xa0\\nto benefit the world. Don‚Äôt forget, whatever\\xa0\\xa0 the topic, we are always talking about proper\\xa0\\nresearch papers in some form over here. Loving it. The image compositor also just got better,\\xa0\\nhere you can finalize your rendered image.\\xa0\\xa0 For instance, if you added a glare effect,\\xa0\\nwhen you play around with these parameters,\\xa0\\xa0 you see their effect better. So you can make\\xa0\\nsure that one light doesn‚Äôt dominate the scene,\\xa0\\xa0 adjust color tint, smoothness, everything.\\xa0\\nMore artistic freedom. Fantastic. I also loved this grab cloth brush which actually\\xa0\\xa0 runs a proper simulation when you\\xa0\\nstart pinching a piece of clothing. Grease pencil also got better, this is a feature\\xa0\\nused to help you draw in 3D space. Enabling sculpt\\xa0\\xa0 mode has a feature called auto masking that helps\\xa0\\nyou draw easily even in the presence of a bunch of\\xa0\\xa0 layers, and you don‚Äôt have to spend lots of time\\xa0\\nfinding the exact layer you want to paint on. And it now has so many small, but meaningful\\xa0\\nchanges to the user interface, for instance,\\xa0\\xa0 you can now see mesh indices, and the visibility\\xa0\\nhas also been improved. Fellow Scholars,\\xa0\\xa0 imagine things like this, times a thousand.\\xa0\\nMore than I can speak about here, amazing. And, did you know that it also has a video\\xa0\\neditor? Almost nobody is talking about it,\\xa0\\xa0 and it has tons of small usability improvements,\\xa0\\nlike faster HDR content rendering and more. And\\xa0\\xa0 if Blender cannot do something that you are\\xa0\\nlooking for? Not a problem, because we haven‚Äôt\\xa0\\xa0 even talked about the fact that you can extend\\xa0\\nits functionality with tons and tons of plugins.\\xa0\\xa0 And so many of these amazing plugins exist,\\xa0\\nit takes half a lifetime just to try a small\\xa0\\xa0 part of them. So much so I am considering making\\xa0\\nanother video just about that relatively soon. I think this is the best free and\\xa0\\nopen source project ever. And you\\xa0\\xa0 don‚Äôt have to start from zero, I always\\xa0\\nsay that you Fellow Scholars should try\\xa0\\xa0 these amazing demo files that also come for\\xa0\\nfree. And my friend Andrew Price‚Äôs legendary\\xa0\\xa0 donut tutorials are also available.\\xa0\\nBoth are in the video description. I have so many great memories writing my research\\xa0\\nworks within Blender, and I really hope that it\\xa0\\xa0 will bring many more to you Fellow Scholars.\\xa0\\nOnce again, all free for all of us. So good!\\xa0\\xa0 A big thank you to all the developers and everyone\\xa0\\nwho donated to make this happen.

This is what we call rasterization. This\\xa0\\nis what most computer games have used for\\xa0\\xa0 many years now. It is super fast and most of the\\xa0\\ntime, it looks good enough. But only if you feel\\xa0\\xa0 that you can live a happy life without super high\\xa0\\nquality reflections and refractions. But not me. Because for that, you need something more. My\\xa0\\nfavorite. Ray tracing. Look at these beauties.\\xa0\\xa0 This you can not get through rasterization, only\\xa0\\nthrough ray tracing, but there is a problem. It\\xa0\\xa0 simulates the path of millions and millions of\\xa0\\nlight rays, which takes super long to compute.\\xa0\\xa0 Like orders of magnitude longer, sometimes\\xa0\\nfrom minutes, to even weeks. Ouch. This one\\xa0\\xa0 is a beauty, reflections, refractions, volumetric\\xa0\\ncaustics, oh my. But it took us 3 weeks to render. So, rasterization, fast, limited, ray\\xa0\\ntracing, a complete solution, but slow. So I guess, choose one right? Well,\\xa0\\nscientists at NVIDIA has an absolutely\\xa0\\xa0 insane idea: they said, why not do both?\\nWell, my opinion was before reading this\\xa0\\xa0 paper ‚Äî don‚Äôt do both because it is impossible\\xa0\\nto pull off. These two ideas are like oil and\\xa0\\xa0 water ‚Äî they don‚Äôt mix. You most likely end\\xa0\\nup with the disadvantages of both. That is,\\xa0\\xa0 a limited, but super expensive\\xa0\\nsolution. No thank you! So,\\xa0\\xa0 did they pull off the impossible?\\xa0\\nWe‚Äôll get to that in a moment. And then, splat happens. I mean,\\xa0\\xa0 a paper called Gaussian Splats came out\\xa0\\nand took the world by storm. What is that? It‚Äôs a technique that thinks in terms of little\\xa0\\nGaussians, representing a scene like this as a\\xa0\\xa0 collection of little bumps if you will. And note\\xa0\\nthat these scenes can come from real life. You\\xa0\\xa0 just walk around with your camera, and then, you\\xa0\\ncan play in a digital version of it. And the cool\\xa0\\xa0 part is that it gets better. It is incredibly\\xa0\\nfast, easily faster than real time. So far so\\xa0\\xa0 good. However, here is the problem: mirror-like\\xa0\\nspecular reflections are not great. And many of\\xa0\\xa0 the beautiful ray tracing effects that you just\\xa0\\nsaw earlier don‚Äôt look so good there. It can also\\xa0\\xa0 eat up quite a bit of memory, which is scarce\\xa0\\nand expensive on graphics hardware these days. But the limitations don‚Äôt stop there: it doesn‚Äôt\\xa0\\nsupport any fancy camera models. For instance,\\xa0\\xa0 fisheye cameras? Don‚Äôt even think about it. Also,\\xa0\\xa0 no camera tricks like rolling shutter. So\\xa0\\nthere is tons of potential in Gaussian splats,\\xa0\\xa0 but if I think about the fact that we get\\xa0\\nno refractions, none of the good stuff that\\xa0\\xa0 we Fellow Scholars love so much. This all\\xa0\\nranges from very difficult to impossible. But don‚Äôt despair, because here comes\\xa0\\nthe impossible, but at the very least,\\xa0\\xa0 insane idea: let‚Äôs do both rasterization\\xa0\\nand ray tracing at the same time.\\xa0 This research work does it by taking Gaussian\\xa0\\nSplatting, and adding to it something they\\xa0\\xa0 call secondary rays. This means that there\\xa0\\nare finally, rays of light in the system,\\xa0\\xa0 and they are allowed to bounce around. So,\\xa0\\nare you thinking what I am thinking? Oh yes,\\xa0\\xa0 hold on to your papers Fellow\\xa0\\nScholars and look at that! A proper virtual world running\\xa0\\nin real time, and high-quality\\xa0\\xa0 reflections. I am absolutely loving this\\xa0\\none. And, refractive objects like glass,\\xa0\\xa0 also‚Ä¶wow. Now let‚Äôs whip out that\\xa0\\nfisheye camera, and‚Ä¶yes! Finally,\\xa0\\xa0 this all used to be impossible, and now it\\xa0\\nis not only here, but it runs in real time. Here comes my favorite part: the\\xa0\\nname of this work. You‚Äôll love\\xa0\\xa0 this. They call it the 3D Gaussian\\xa0\\nUnscented Transform. 3D G U T. Yup,\\xa0\\xa0 but that‚Äôs not how we will call it. No\\xa0\\nsir! We shall call it 3DGUT. Much better! And here is a nice little surprise. Do you know\\xa0\\nwhat super important AI area likes weird camera\\xa0\\xa0 models and rolling shutter? Training self-driving\\xa0\\ncars. Oh yes. And this is going to be super useful\\xa0\\xa0 for that too. But is it really better than\\xa0\\nprevious techniques? Let‚Äôs see together. Dear Fellow Scholars, this is Two Minute\\xa0\\nPapers with Dr. K√°roly Zsolnai-Feh√©r. So, 3DGUT looks amazing, but we are Fellow\\xa0\\nScholars here, we want to see the comparisons\\xa0\\xa0 against previous techniques. Well, turns out,\\xa0\\nthere is one earlier method that can extend\\xa0\\xa0 Gaussian Splats to fisheye cameras, but‚Ä¶oof. I\\xa0\\nsee lots and lots of artifacts and distortions\\xa0\\xa0 here. So do you have the guts to have a\\xa0\\nlook at the new technique? Let‚Äôs see‚Ä¶oh\\xa0\\xa0 my, that is a huge difference. The\\xa0\\nprevious one had trouble especially\\xa0\\xa0 with objects that are closer to the\\xa0\\ncamera, but this new one. Loving it. But the story doesn‚Äôt end\\xa0\\nhere. There is so much more\\xa0\\xa0 below the surface. We are going\\xa0\\nto look at this too in a moment. And here comes the best part: they didn‚Äôt\\xa0\\njust close it down to sell it to us. Nope.\\xa0\\xa0 All this is available right now for all of\\xa0\\nus for free. The source code is out there,\\xa0\\xa0 I‚Äôve put a link in the video description, so\\xa0\\nI hope you Fellow Scholars have the guts to\\xa0\\xa0 play with it. Sorry, I promised myself not\\xa0\\ndo it again and I just did. But in fact,\\xa0\\xa0 some of you already do play with it! This Fellow\\xa0\\nScholar says that he trained it to only 30%,\\xa0\\xa0 and it already looks amazing, even through\\xa0\\nthe compression artifacts from social media. Okay, but I hear you asking, wait a\\xa0\\nminute K√°roly. What is this beauty?\\xa0\\xa0 Well, I said that there is more below\\xa0\\nthe surface. I said that because this\\xa0\\xa0 other work is about light transport that\\xa0\\nhappens within these objects. That is,\\xa0\\xa0 subsurface scattering. The art of\\xa0\\nrendering beautiful translucent objects. Now, you can do this in rasterization, here is\\xa0\\na work called Separable Subsurface Scattering,\\xa0\\xa0 it gives you super fast human skin, marble,\\xa0\\nmilk, you name it. I love working on things\\xa0\\xa0 like this so much. And it is so simple, when\\xa0\\nwe published it, we even implemented a version\\xa0\\xa0 of it that fits into 4 kilobytes. That is\\xa0\\ncrazy ‚Äî it fits into a file that is smaller\\xa0\\xa0 than half a second of mp3 music. Much smaller.\\xa0\\nIt is available on my website, the link is in\\xa0\\xa0 the description. To the best of my knowledge,\\xa0\\nyou can also use it in Unreal Engine as well. So this is subsurface scattering, but for\\xa0\\nrasterization, not for Gaussian Splats. What\\xa0\\xa0 about that? Well, this amazing new work offers\\xa0\\nyou exactly that. And it gets even better,\\xa0\\xa0 it supports relighting too. So you\\xa0\\nhave your object, you add an image,\\xa0\\xa0 and it imagines what that object would look\\xa0\\nlike in these different environments. Super fun. And if you don‚Äôt like what you got,\\xa0\\nyou can even edit these materials,\\xa0\\xa0 so you can go from skin to glass to wax.\\xa0\\nI mean, just think about that. Gaussian\\xa0\\xa0 Splats are not old at all, it‚Äôs about 2\\xa0\\nyears old. And now, through the power of\\xa0\\xa0 open research and human ingenuity, and\\xa0\\na hint of AI, reflections, refractions,\\xa0\\xa0 and translucency is already possible for Gaussian\\xa0\\nSplats. Yes, now you can get reasonably high\\xa0\\xa0 quality translucent objects in these virtual\\xa0\\nworlds too. So, next level computer games and\\xa0\\xa0 virtual worlds are coming! And self-driving cars\\xa0\\ncan also learn better. I am kind of stunned that\\xa0\\xa0 almost nobody is talking about these papers.\\xa0\\nBut this is why Two Minute Papers exists. And don‚Äôt forget, we are all Fellow Scholars\\xa0\\nhere, so we love to look at these papers for\\xa0\\xa0 more information, and it goes without saying that\\xa0\\neverything is available in the video description. So, what do you think? What\\xa0\\nwould you Fellow Scholars\\xa0\\xa0 use this for?

So, what just happened? Scientists at OpenAI\\xa0\\nshowcased their new thinking model, o3,\\xa0\\xa0 and so much more. It can now think with images,\\xa0\\xa0 then help you learn more, and\\xa0\\nmaybe even help you land a job. And, just a year ago, these AI systems had\\xa0\\nan IQ that was below the human average,\\xa0\\xa0 and now? Are you kidding me? OpenAI‚Äôs o3 has\\xa0\\na genius level IQ. Now I‚Äôll note that we are\\xa0\\xa0 Fellow Scholars here, we are a bit skeptical of\\xa0\\nsuch claims, especially that this does not come\\xa0\\xa0 from a peer-reviewed paper. So let‚Äôs have\\xa0\\na look ourselves. How does all this work? First, it is thinking with images.\\xa0\\nLittle AI, here is an image,\\xa0\\xa0 now tell me what is the name of the biggest ship\\xa0\\nhere and where will it go next? And now, you can\\xa0\\xa0 actually see the thinking process, this time with\\xa0\\nimages, and there we go. An absolute miracle. Now let‚Äôs make it tougher. Your task is\\xa0\\nread this sign. Wait a second‚Ä¶my first\\xa0\\xa0 reaction to this was‚Ä¶what sign? Look, there\\xa0\\nis a tiny tiny sign on the building ‚Äî there\\xa0\\xa0 is no way you can read that, right?\\xa0\\nWell, check this out. It looks at it,\\xa0\\xa0 knows where to zoom in, and I am pretty sure\\xa0\\nit is cleaning up this image automatically,\\xa0\\xa0 trying to find out what‚Äôs written.\\xa0\\nAnd, there you go. Unbelievable. Now, here‚Äôs a picture, what movies were\\xa0\\nfilmed here? That is not something that\\xa0\\xa0 you can do with just an easy search, you\\xa0\\nwould need someone in the know for this. Or,\\xa0\\xa0 just ask o3, and two and a half\\xa0\\nminutes later, boom, there you go. And, yes, I hear you Fellow Scholars\\xa0\\nasking, but can it find Waldo? And the\\xa0\\xa0 answer is‚Ä¶yes. Yes it can. You may even\\xa0\\nbe able to just take a photo of a menu,\\xa0\\xa0 and it might find the restaurant that has\\xa0\\nthat menu. Or, just take a photo of Slash,\\xa0\\xa0 or some guitar hero, and ask what chord they\\xa0\\nare playing. Hint: it‚Äôs an E. It is always\\xa0\\xa0 an E. An don‚Äôt forget, it can not just talk\\xa0\\nabout images, it can even mark them up. Here,\\xa0\\xa0 it did so with where it found some issues\\xa0\\nwith small samples of fabric. Incredible. And believe it or not, it gets better. Its memory\\xa0\\nis getting better and better. For instance,\\xa0\\xa0 you can do the following: little AI, read\\xa0\\neverything that we talked about before,\\xa0\\xa0 maybe years and years of data,\\xa0\\nand now ‚Äî you can ask it to tell\\xa0\\xa0 you what it knows about you and teach\\xa0\\nyou something that you don‚Äôt know yet. In this example, he likes scuba\\xa0\\ndiving and music. o3 knows that.\\xa0 And here comes something mind-blowing. It starts\\xa0\\nteaching him about coral larvae, underwater baby\\xa0\\xa0 corals if you will. And they can detect reef\\xa0\\nsounds. They prefer the natural soundscape of\\xa0\\xa0 healthy reefs and if they hear them, they are\\xa0\\nmore likely to attach and grow when exposed\\xa0\\xa0 to them. So, crazy experiment: put loudspeakers\\xa0\\nunderwater, pipe in the sound of a healthy reef,\\xa0\\xa0 and there you go. They love it. So much so that\\xa0\\nthey swim toward the sound and settle there. Wow. Imagine someone knowing you so well and\\xa0\\nteaching you this. If this would be a person,\\xa0\\xa0 we would say that this person\\xa0\\nis very kind and thoughtful.\\xa0\\xa0 And we might say the same thing for a\\xa0\\nmachine. I think that is incredible. And now that you know about this, you can ask\\xa0\\nagain, it knows that you know this already,\\xa0\\xa0 and then it can teach you something new. Maybe\\xa0\\nyou are looking for a job as a research scientist,\\xa0\\xa0 and once again, it knows what\\xa0\\nyou know, but more importantly,\\xa0\\xa0 it knows what you don‚Äôt know, and will be\\xa0\\nable to help you to prepare for an interview. But it can do more. A lot more. They showed how it\\xa0\\ndid a big bunch of tests, okay, but what do these\\xa0\\xa0 really mean, and which one of these matter?\\nWell, I reckon you should look at this one.\\xa0\\xa0 Humanity‚Äôs Last Exam. The toughest test\\xa0\\nfor the toughest AIs out there. Questions\\xa0\\xa0 from smart scientists from all around the world\\xa0\\nthat no AI could answer at the time it was made. We just talked about it two videos ago, and I\\xa0\\nam super happy to see it tested on some more.\\xa0\\xa0 I don‚Äôt assume that it has to do anything with\\xa0\\nwhat I said but I am loving seeing this. So,\\xa0\\xa0 what is the result? Just a couple months ago,\\xa0\\n8% was what the best AI could do at it. Now,\\xa0\\xa0 hold on to your papers Fellow Scholars, because\\xa0\\nwe are approaching 25%. 25%! That is stunning.\\xa0\\xa0 About 3x in just a couple of months. I\\xa0\\nam out of words. By the end of the year,\\xa0\\xa0 we might get over 50-60% and that will be for\\xa0\\nme, another breakthrough. A historic moment. Why? Well, because we will probably have an\\xa0\\nanswer to a super important question,\\xa0\\xa0 and that is: Is it a bit like a\\xa0\\nreal scientist? Can it do research? Dear Fellow Scholars, this is Two Minute\\xa0\\nPapers with Dr. K√°roly Zsolnai-Feh√©r. Well, here is an indication\\xa0\\nof what it already can do.\\xa0\\xa0 You Fellow Scholars are going to love this one. It has been fed a piece of research\\xa0\\nwork that is incomplete, and now it\\xa0\\xa0 is asked to finish it. That is challenging\\xa0\\ntask. And‚Ä¶look. This is really cool. It is\\xa0\\xa0 showing us what it is looking at, zooming in,\\xa0\\nit shows you the thinking process. Once again,\\xa0\\xa0 it thinks with images. Not just with text.\\xa0\\nFantastic. So what does that give us here? Well, assuming that the experiment was\\xa0\\ncarefully done, so that ChatGPT can not\\xa0\\xa0 just look up the calculations somewhere,\\xa0\\nthat seems to me like doing research. That\\xa0\\xa0 is a game changer. You know, previously,\\xa0\\nyou heard that these AI systems are nice,\\xa0\\xa0 but they only can work within the convex\\xa0\\nhull of our knowledge. That means it can\\xa0\\xa0 do what we can do. But from this point on,\\xa0\\nit seems that it can push us forward as well. And I said you Fellow Scholars are going\\xa0\\nto love it. Why? Well, because here,\\xa0\\xa0 it is re-inventing something that\\xa0\\nhas been invented. And very soon,\\xa0\\xa0 I am hoping to see it invent things that\\xa0\\nwe couldn‚Äôt invent yet. Pushing humanity\\xa0\\xa0 forward. You know, advancing drug design,\\xa0\\nbetter crops, clean energy, longevity,\\xa0\\xa0 these would really push humanity forward. And\\xa0\\nI think it is coming very soon. Incredible. They also announced Codex, a coding\\xa0\\nagent. But not only for coders. This\\xa0\\xa0 is pretty much for everyone. Here you\\xa0\\ndon‚Äôt even need to write a huge prompt,\\xa0\\xa0 you just refer to something a different\\xa0\\nFellow Scholar did on social media, that is,\\xa0\\xa0 creating beautiful ASCII character art from an\\xa0\\nimage. And it writes a real-time app that does\\xa0\\xa0 this with your image from your camera and in real\\xa0\\ntime. That is stunning. What a time to be alive! I would like to close with a little trick that\\xa0\\nI just started using. And I love it. In the app,\\xa0\\xa0 go to your profile, personalization, customize\\xa0\\nChatGPT, and there, ask it for the following:\\xa0 ‚ÄúLook for peer-reviewed sources for every\\xa0\\nanswer. Rate the credibility of that source\\xa0\\xa0 on a scale of 0 to 10 for every source.‚Äù\\nAnd of course, don‚Äôt forget to ask for more\\xa0\\xa0 emoji! Ha! You can copy this little message\\xa0\\nin there, I put it in the description. So when you ask about the IQ of OpenAI‚Äôs o3,\\xa0\\nit shows you results, but not just the results\\xa0\\xa0 but the difference between speculation and\\xa0\\nstandardized testing. When it says 8 out of 10,\\xa0\\xa0 I would give it more like a 5 or a 6 at most,\\xa0\\nbut that‚Äôs okay ‚Äî I can just refine my system\\xa0\\xa0 prompt to make it a bit more strict. You can\\xa0\\ndo it too. That is The Way Of The Scholar. Note that works on any chatbot. And\\xa0\\nnow, whenever you get an answer,\\xa0\\xa0 you get a source you can look up, or\\xa0\\nsometimes you might not even need to look\\xa0\\xa0 up all the sources because ChatGPT knows they\\xa0\\nexist, but are not necessarily that credible. By the way, this video took a bit longer.\\xa0\\nWe are not the ones who just put out a poor\\xa0\\xa0 quality video super quickly to get all of those\\xa0\\nviews. No. We‚Äôre cooking it slowly. You know that\\xa0\\xa0 slow cooking takes time, but it is the best way\\xa0\\nto cook. Especially for papers. More context,\\xa0\\xa0 more examples, more papers. Yummy.\\xa0\\nSo in the end, you get better videos,\\xa0\\xa0 hopefully. I am trying my best here.\\xa0\\nLike and subscribe if you appreciate it. So, how did your Scholarly experiments\\xa0\\ngo?

Yikes‚Ä¶ I kinda love it. So\\xa0\\xa0 what is going on here? You see, most simulations\\xa0\\nin computer games are about simulating solids.\\xa0\\xa0 That‚Äôs the boring stuff. But what about when\\xa0\\nwe try to destroy things and they deform? And then, we will do increasingly crazier\\xa0\\nthings, like this, and then this, and at the end,\\xa0\\xa0 this insane thing. And then I‚Äôll tell you\\xa0\\nwhy I am heartbroken. Dear Fellow Scholars,\\xa0\\xa0 this is Two Minute Papers\\xa0\\nwith Dr. K√°roly Zsolnai-Feh√©r. Hmm‚Ä¶yes! Now I see the appeal of simulating\\xa0\\ndeformations, that would be amazing,\\xa0\\xa0 but doing this on a larger scale, that is so\\xa0\\nmuch more difficult, and takes much, much longer.\\xa0\\xa0 Dropping a spiky mace on this city is a beauty,\\xa0\\nbut some of these simulations can take 3 hours\\xa0\\xa0 to compute or even longer, wow, that is brutal.\\xa0\\nI mean, the simulation, and the waiting time too. But wait, maybe this new paper\\xa0\\ncan help us. Although I doubt it,\\xa0\\xa0 because it would take simulating\\xa0\\n2.5 million tetrahedra, these\\xa0\\xa0 tiny little elements. That sounds\\xa0\\nvery painful. Like, this painful. However, it can compute a simulation, once\\xa0\\nagain, kinda brutal, and surprisingly,\\xa0\\xa0 it gets even better. Don‚Äôt forget,\\xa0\\nthis is a virtual world. Our world,\\xa0\\xa0 so what does that mean? It means we do whatever\\xa0\\nwe want. We can control the stiffness of these\\xa0\\xa0 objects with one physical parameter. Just change\\xa0\\nit, and then, look, we just made that jelly a bit\\xa0\\xa0 more rubberized. Fantastic. Do it some more, and\\xa0\\nnow the anvil barely bounces off of it. Loving it. So, let‚Äôs pop the question. Big breath -\\xa0\\nso, how fast is it? Now hold on to your\\xa0\\xa0 papers Fellow Scholars, because when I saw\\xa0\\nthis, my goodness ‚Äî I couldn‚Äôt believe my\\xa0\\xa0 eyes. It is between 3 and 300 times faster\\xa0\\nthan previous methods. Some of the smaller\\xa0\\xa0 simulations take only a few seconds, so\\xa0\\nperhaps just one more paper down the line,\\xa0\\xa0 and we might just have this in real\\xa0\\ntime in our video games. Loving it. Now, when talking about cloth simulations,\\xa0\\njust look at that. This other work really\\xa0\\xa0 knows how to do these really tough\\xa0\\ntwisty cases. But it gets better. And\\xa0\\xa0 not just because it can simulate the flag\\xa0\\nof Catifornia flawlessly, well done there. But typically, when we want to achieve\\xa0\\nsomething in a computer game or animated movie,\\xa0\\xa0 we can‚Äôt compute a full-scale simulation\\xa0\\nlike this because it can take from hours\\xa0\\xa0 to days to compute. No-no. First, we\\xa0\\ncompute a coarse simulation quickly,\\xa0\\xa0 see if it has promise, but‚Ä¶oof. We have a huge\\xa0\\nproblem here. We can‚Äôt do this. Do you see why?\\xa0\\xa0 Making a finer version of a coarse\\xa0\\nsimulation behaves entirely differently. So we have to wait for days for the final\\xa0\\nsimulation. And this is not what I want‚Ä¶I mean,\\xa0\\xa0 having to wait so long to get a chance to\\xa0\\nthrow it a bit differently again. No thanks! But, with incredible method, look. Yes, that is\\xa0\\nwhat I want! A perfectly designed experiment.\\xa0\\xa0 We do the coarse experiment quickly, and\\xa0\\nclear all three rings. Finally! And normally,\\xa0\\xa0 we saw that we do the finer\\xa0\\nversion of the simulation,\\xa0\\xa0 something entirely different happens. And in\\xa0\\nthis case‚Ä¶I can‚Äôt believe it. Fast previewing\\xa0\\xa0 of a difficult simulation is now possible, and\\xa0\\nthe outcome remains the same when running the\\xa0\\xa0 full workload afterwards. I‚Äôve never\\xa0\\nseen anything like this before. Bravo! So if you want to make cats kiss or have\\xa0\\nthese octocats fall into their own containers,\\xa0\\xa0 you can simulate that very, very quickly,\\xa0\\nand then only do the fine simulation once,\\xa0\\xa0 afterwards. Yes, these are us Fellow Scholars\\xa0\\nwhen seeing this amazing paper at work. And while computer games still have lots of\\xa0\\nproblems like this that we call z-fighting,\\xa0\\xa0 where often two seemingly simple objects just\\xa0\\ncan‚Äôt decide who should be in front. But,\\xa0\\xa0 look at this. Holy mother of Papers! In the\\xa0\\nmeantime, scientists are doing their best,\\xa0\\xa0 and, goodness, modeling crazy topology\\xa0\\nchanges with these beautiful bubbles is\\xa0\\xa0 also now possible. Just look at that. Imagine\\xa0\\nsitting down and having to write a handcrafted\\xa0\\xa0 computer program to be able to do all that.\\xa0\\nThis ingenuity is humanity at its best. Or with this, you can also stack a bunch\\xa0\\nof objects together in twisty ways,\\xa0\\xa0 and when you look inside. Let‚Äôs see‚Ä¶I\\xa0\\ndon‚Äôt see any fighting at all. Fantastic. And I kept the my favorite for last.\\xa0\\nOh my‚Ä¶are you seeing what I am seeing?\\xa0\\xa0 Simulating a piece of fluid\\xa0\\nthat is magnetic. Ferrofluids! It‚Äôs very simple, except the fact\\xa0\\nthat it is close to impossible.\\xa0\\xa0 Let me explain. All you need to do is to\\xa0\\nput a magnet under a piece of ferrofluid,\\xa0\\xa0 and these magical spikes start appearing. That\\xa0\\nis simple. Now sit down, and write a computer\\xa0\\xa0 program that is capable of simulating that. Now\\xa0\\nthat Fellow Scholars, is nearly impossible. Yes,\\xa0\\xa0 you have to understand and program all this\\xa0\\ncrazy stuff to be able to pull this off. So what is going on here? Well, this work offers\\xa0\\nsomething they call an Induce-on-Boundary solver.\\xa0\\xa0 What it can do is that it does not perform the\\xa0\\ncomputations on the entire 3D volume of the fluid,\\xa0\\xa0 only on the 2 dimensional surface of the\\xa0\\nfluid. Only compute on the shell. That\\xa0\\xa0 is much quicker. And they pulled it off in a\\xa0\\nway that offers more favorable computational\\xa0\\xa0 speeds than previous works, and can be\\xa0\\ndropped into an existing fluid simulator. And this is how you can create these amazing\\xa0\\nfluid mazes and other insane experiments. I\\xa0\\xa0 love these works so much. That is a problem\\xa0\\nI will tell you about it in a moment. Yes,\\xa0\\xa0 you still have to wait for quite a while, but you\\xa0\\nknow, for this kind of quality, I‚Äôll let it slip. And you know, everyone talks AI this, AI\\xa0\\nthat, but I see AI as a tool to enhance\\xa0\\xa0 the minds of these incredibly brilliant\\xa0\\nresearchers. Just imagine what we will be\\xa0\\xa0 capable of just two more papers down\\xa0\\nthe line. What a time to be alive! And now, look at this. My heart is\\xa0\\nbroken as almost nobody is seeing or\\xa0\\xa0 talking about these amazing papers. Can you\\xa0\\nbelieve that? Here, on Two Minute Papers,\\xa0\\xa0 you can learn about works often no one else is\\xa0\\ntalking about, but here is the problem ‚Äî it is\\xa0\\xa0 almost impossible to keep the flame alive\\xa0\\nfor simulation papers like this. You see,\\xa0\\xa0 a few hundred episodes ago, we had ones\\xa0\\nthat did really well, and Youtube kept\\xa0\\xa0 recommending these episodes. And I get it, I\\xa0\\nmean, look at this insane quality work. Wow. But unfortunately, Youtube is not recommending\\xa0\\nthem to you too much anymore, so every time I am\\xa0\\xa0 just here talking to myself whenever I do that.\\xa0\\nProbably this time too. Hello K√°roly! Hello,\\xa0\\xa0 how are you doing? Doing great, thank you!\\xa0\\nExcept that it‚Äôs been almost a thousand Two\\xa0\\xa0 Minute Papers videos, God is my witness I tried\\xa0\\neverything since. If it‚Äôs a simulation paper,\\xa0\\xa0 nothing works. I am heartbroken. I don‚Äôt really\\xa0\\nhave a solution, but if you keep watching these,\\xa0\\xa0 posting them, and recommending them to your\\xa0\\nfriends, maybe one day. Maybe. So thank you\\xa0\\xa0 for being with me on this journey for almost\\xa0\\n10 years now! This is my dream job and we\\xa0\\xa0 couldn‚Äôt exist without you Fellow Scholars.\\xa0\\nLet me know in the comments what you think.', research_papers=[], key_concepts=[], implementation_ideas=[], agent_recommendations=[], uploaded_date='20250420', duration='8:42', view_count=79028)"
